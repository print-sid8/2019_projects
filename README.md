Below are some of the projects you will find here.

## Project #1 - Object Recognition

In the 'Object-Identification' repository, I have added the pre-requisites required and have attached my Python codes for each step of the process.

The documentation with instructions of how to run it, is ina pdf file in the repo.

## Project #2 - Real Time Tweet Map

In 	RealTimeTwitterMap repository, I have written a small documentation and step-by-step process to complete this application. It will require the help of the Youtube channel 'Code & Dogs' to complete a few critical steps in this project, thank you to him.

## Project #3 - Real Time Twitter Sentiment Graph


This project if completed will result in a Live Graph that shows the sentiment around the keyword that you provided to it, shown to you in a localhost server. I would like to thank SentDex and his webpage - https://pythonprogramming.net/ for tutorials. I have modified the code to work on latest verion of Dash as of 21-10-2019 ie., 1.4.1
