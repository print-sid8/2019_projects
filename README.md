# Welcome to Sid's GitHub

Below are some of the projects in this page.

## Project #1 - Object Recognition

In the 'Object-Identification' repository, I have added the pre-requisites required and have attached my codes and documentation for each step of the process.

## Project #2 - Real Time Tweet Map

In 	RealTimeTwitterMap repository, I have written a small documentation and step-by-step process to complete this application. It will require the help of the Youtube channel 'Code & Dogs' to complete a few critical steps in this project, thank you to him.

## Project #3 - Real Time Twitter Sentiment Graph

This project if completed will result in a Live Graph that shows the sentiment around the keyword that you provided to it, shown to you in a localhost server. I would like to thank SentDex and his webpage - https://pythonprogramming.net/ for tutorials. I have modified the code to work on latest verion of Dash as of 21-10-2019 ie., 1.4.1

## Thank you for reading!
